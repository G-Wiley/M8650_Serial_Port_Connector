# M8650_Serial_Port_Connector
A small connector board to make an easy connection to the 40-pin Berg header on the DEC M8650, KL8E Asynchronous Data Control board. This board makes it easy to build a cable for RS-232, USB TTL serial, or Teletype interfaces.

For each of the three interfaces, there are pairs of holes to insert a zip-tie to secure the serial cable to the circuit board. For each interface, the cable wires can either be soldered directly to the connector board for maximum durability, or a single-row header can be used for more flexibility. A 6-pin single-row header serves as an input selection device. A small jumper-cap can be installed in one of three places to select either RS-232, USB TTL serial, or Teletype interfaces to be the serial input to the M8650 board. Alternatively, a small jumper wire can be soldered into one of the three possible positions if the cable is intended to have a single purpose.
